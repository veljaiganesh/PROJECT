# Breast Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting breast cancer from histopathological images. Using deep learning techniques, we classify these images into benign or malignant classes to assist in the early detection of breast cancer.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection through image analysis can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment. This project leverages CNNs, a type of deep learning model, to classify histopathological images into different categories based on the presence of malignant or benign cells.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Histopathology Images** dataset. The dataset contains labeled histopathological images of breast tissue that have been classified into benign or malignant categories. This dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

- **Source**: [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)
- **Classes**: Malignant (IDC) and Benign (Non-IDC)
- **Image Size**: 50x50 pixel patches

## Installation

### Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/breast-cancer-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-detection
   ```
3. Run the notebook or the Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Classification_project.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

The notebook is structured as follows:
1. **Importing Libraries**: All necessary libraries are imported for processing and training the model.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is downloaded and loaded into the environment, with sample images printed.
3. **Model Building**: A CNN is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras to classify the images.
4. **Training**: The model is trained using the loaded dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated on test data to assess performance.

## Results

After training the CNN model, we achieve a certain level of accuracy and F1-score in classifying the breast histopathology images. The confusion matrix and classification report are generated to summarize the results.
